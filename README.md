In this repository, I share some of the Jupyter notebooks I use in the Network Science class I offer under the [Asian Institute of Management](https://aim.edu/)'s [MSc. in Data Science](https://erikalegara.site/msds-unplugged/) program where Network Science is a core data science course.

### Table of Contents

2. [Intro to Network Models](https://github.com/eflegara/Network-Science/blob/master/CN%20Models.ipynb)
3. [Exploring Network Vulnerability and Robustness with Centrality Measures](https://github.com/eflegara/Network-Science/blob/master/Centrality%20Measures.ipynb)
4. [Community Detection in Complex Networks](https://github.com/eflegara/Network-Science/blob/master/Community%20Detection.ipynb)
5. [Error and Attack in Complex Networks](https://github.com/eflegara/Network-Science/blob/master/Error%20and%20Attack%20Tolerance.ipynb)
6. [Application: Exploring Vaccination Strategies](https://github.com/eflegara/Network-Science/blob/master/Vaccination%20Strategies.ipynb)
7. [Application: Social Distancing (An Elementary Model)](https://github.com/eflegara/Network-Science/blob/master/Exploring%20Social%20Distancing.ipynb)

### Dependencies

Just make sure you have [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) installed in your machine. We are also using the Louvain Method in the detecting communities, so install the [`python-louvain` library](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain) as well.
